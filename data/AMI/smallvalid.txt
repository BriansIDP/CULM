OKAY
SO AS YOU GUYS KNOW F ISSCO IS TOO SMALL
WELL THE BUILDING IS TOO SMALL FOR OUR GROUP
SO WE'RE MOVING TO A NEW BUILDING
UH IT'S GONNA BE THE BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET
AND WE'RE ACTUALLY MOVING IN THREE WEEKS
BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO KNOW WHO IS GOING TO BE IN WHAT OFFICE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND WHERE WE'RE G WE'RE GONNA PUT THINGS LIKE THE PRINTER
THE FAX MACHINE ALL THE BIG EQUIPMENT
AND THE CATCH IS THAT THEY HAVE THE FINAL APPROVAL OF WHERE WE PUT PEOPLE AND EQUIPMENT
AND THEY WANT TO KNOW WHERE WE'RE GONNA DO ALL THIS BY NOVEMBER SECOND
SO THAT MEANS BASICALLY NEXT TUESDAY
AND SINCE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY OTHER TIME WE HAVE TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS TODAY
